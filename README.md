# Advent of Code 2021 in C++

Completing daily the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2021) challanges to improve my C++ skills.

### Compile and run the code yourself:


_day01 -> day10_
Navigate to the `day01/` directory
```bash
g++ -std=c++11 day01.cpp -o day01.out
./day01.out
```
For the sake of time I've decided to switch to python

_day12 -> dayXX_
```bash
python3 day12.py {part}
```
